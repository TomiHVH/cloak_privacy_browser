# Cloak Browser - Enhanced Modular Structure

## Overview

Cloak Browser has evolved from a single monolithic JavaScript file into a sophisticated, modular architecture that provides comprehensive privacy protection, performance optimization, and enhanced user experience while maintaining clean, maintainable code.

## Architecture Evolution

### Initial State
The browser began as a single `ui.js` file containing over 3000 lines of code, making it difficult to maintain, debug, and extend.

### Current Architecture
The browser now features a hybrid approach where all advanced features are integrated into `ui.js` while maintaining modular organization through internal class structures and clear separation of concerns.
